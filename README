Forgive the mess!

Anyways, this only works with a gmail-based host account, however any mail
account can be a user. To run, perform the following:

LedgerDriver.py <pop_server> <port> <gmail_username> <gmail_password>

For assistance, send email with the subject 'ledger' with message 'ledger help'
to <gmail_username>@gmail.com
