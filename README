Forgive the mess!

Anyways, this only works with a gmail-based host account, however any mail
account can be a user. To run, perform the following:

LedgerDriver.py <pop_server> <port> <gmail_username> <gmail_password>

To run unittests, perform the following from the top directory:

<python> -m unittest discover <test_dir> "*Test.py"

<test_dir> - the directory you wish to test
